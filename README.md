In this project, I worked on predicting customer churn for an e-commerce platform using machine learning techniques.
The goal was to determine whether a customer is likely to stop using the service based on their behavior and attributes.
I began by cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, converting all categorical values into numeric form and applying scaling to improve model performance.
After preparing the data, I explored and compared several classification algorithms to find the most effective model for churn prediction.

The models I implemented included:
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

I split the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing, and evaluated the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC curves.
